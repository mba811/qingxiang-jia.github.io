PLU is the perfect fit for me, but each person should visit those campuses he or she is most interested in to see whether they feel at home or not. Stay overnight in a dorm room if possible. After all, you can only pick one school to attend, and you'll be there for four years. Make sure that it's the best possible fit for you!

I think that the school has a lot to offer and it can really be a place that you can grow and learn. The staff are friendly and approachable and if you look, you can get help from counselors, pastors, and facility if need be. Overall, I enjoyed the university. I had to learn how to use the system a few times. But once you figure out how the university is run, you can really make it work to your advantage.

The major groups on campus include the Jocks/Preps, musicians and artists, and indie-coffee drinking students. Each group always has a stereotypical member such as the right and obnoxious athlete, the pompous artist, and the pariah. \\-Education quality is excellent. The professors are easily accessible by email and phone and students can see the passion and compassion from the professors. \\-Office staffs are impatient and snooty. I will never forget the unwelcoming voices of the student services center. \\-There are many reliable resources such as medical assistance and counseling. \\-Parkland/Tacoma is the most dull and unattractive suburb/city in Washington. If you have sensitive eyes, a weak heart, and high hope of a nightlife, PLU is not the school for you. \\-It's difficult making friends without having to establish a "label". Most students tend to stay within their "labels". \\-Politically, there is a fine line between democrats and republicans with a few moderates here and there. \\-It is an heavily athletic oriented environment. \\-tuition will empty out your pockets unless you have a severe economic status, bright enough to get scholarships, or you have rich parents. If you aren't from the best financial backgrounds, plu is good at compiling a good financial aid package. IF you're just in the middle, good luck at finding student loans with low APR. overall on considering plu: education quality: yes nightlife: NO scenery: NO stable social life: NO adequate Resouces: NO Library quality: NO dining services: Medium Preparedness:\*\*-\*\*, Reputation:\*\*-\*\*!\[Image 1\]\[\]\[ \]\[Link 3\]\[\*\*Have a Question?\*\* \]\[Link 3\] \*\*\[Communications\]\[\]\*\* \[!\[Image 1\]\[\]\]\[Image 1 1\] Major\[ Salary, \]\[Salary\_ 3\]\[ Salary Trend, \]\[Salary Trend\_ 3\]\[ Satisfaction, \]\[Satisfaction\_ 3\]\[ Unemployment \]\[Unemployment 3\]!\[Image 1\]\[\] PLU is an excellent school to attend and really challenges you, in and out of the classroom. Students and professors are very friendly and trusting (professors would even leave classrooms DURING a test and cheating was not even considered).
