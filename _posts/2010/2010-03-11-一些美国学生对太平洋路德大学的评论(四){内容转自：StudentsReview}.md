\*\*\[Political Science\]\[\]\*\* \[!\[Image 1\]\[\]\]\[Image 1 1\] Major\[ Salary, \]\[Salary\_\]\[ Salary Trend, \]\[Salary Trend\_\]\[ Satisfaction, \]\[Satisfaction\_\]\[ Unemployment \]\[Unemployment\]!\[Image 1\]\[\] I enjoyed my time at PLU. It provided a well-rounded education and a good foundation for law school. Becoming involved in sports and campus activities was easy. Prospective students who are not from Western Washington need to be prepared for gray, dreary, rainy days. They are the norm but when the sun shines the campus is glorious.

The students and teachers are very helpful. There is also a tutoring center which is very helpful when finals come around! There are a lot of ways to get involved on campus. There are many sports teams and clubs. I don't feel like there are the typical high school stereo-types at PLU. I have found that pretty everyone are friends with everyone. There also isn't a lot of drama. Most of the students are at Pacific Lutheran University to get a good education, and are very encouraging to one another. But also know when to get go and have some fun on the weekends. Education Quality:\*\*A+\*\*, Collaboration/Competitive:\*\*B+\*\*!\[Image 1\]\[\]\[ 1 responses\]\[1 responses\]\[\*\*Have a Question?\*\* \]\[1 responses\] \*\*\[Business - Management and Administration\]\[\]\*\* \[!\[Image 1\]\[\]\]\[Image 1 1\] Major\[ Salary, \]\[Salary\_ 1\]\[ Salary Trend, \]\[Salary Trend\_ 1\]\[ Satisfaction, \]\[Satisfaction\_ 1\]\[ Unemployment \]\[Unemployment 1\]!\[Image 1\]\[\] The professors know what they are teaching, but at the same time, atleast in the business department, they are not the most approachable. Most of the students who are driven and ambitious agree that PLU is an aweful school, while some of my friends that are not the most driven, say that PLU is an awesome school academicly. If you do a search of the area around PLU of convicted sex offenders you will see it is a breeding ground for them. There were 14 convicted sex offenders in a 1/2 radius of my house just off campus.
