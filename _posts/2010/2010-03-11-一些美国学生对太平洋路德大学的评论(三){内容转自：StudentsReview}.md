Please do not go waste 3-5 years at this place. You're going to start developing a bad taste in your mouth about this place towards the end of your degree, and be sorry you wasted 120k going here.

When I went to graduate school I didn't know how I would hold up compared to students from more "prominent" schools. However, not only could I hold my own, I thrived. PLU prepared me to do unique, creative research with depth and rigor. I was confident in my skills, but not ignorant to challenge. I know what high standards are, and I know how to meet them. PLU was a fantastic place to study, and live during college. I have absolutely NO regrets about the experience, and I know that at PLU I studied and learned differently.
