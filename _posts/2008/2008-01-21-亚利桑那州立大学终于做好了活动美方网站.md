”The Arizona State University is partnering with the Chinese government-run web site, China.com.cn, to host the Chinese Space Youth Academy. In this event, thousands of Chinese high school students are competing to show their knowledge of space exploration subjects. The winners will come to the United States in January 2008 to join a group of Arizona high school students for a 10-day hands-on space exploration experience.“
