但是，在XLib下编写游戏会导致灭亡。我们怎样做出像 Planet Penguin Racer 和Super Tux一样的游戏的呢？ The main reason should be two inventions here: OpenGL and SDL. 这主要应该归结为两样发明：OpenGl和SDL。 OpenGL opened a new world in computer graphics. Being mostly a Silicon Graphics thing, it was for sure a UNIX-friendly thing. OpenGL打开了计算机图形处理的新世界。就像大部分硅芯片的图像处理一样，他是和Unix相兼容的。 Of course, after passing the hurdles of getting a X window with OpenGL content. With OpenGL we could finally get our Quake after a hard workday. 当然，在经历了重重阻碍让X window成为OpenGL的一部分。用 OpenGL，经过努力，我们最终得到了Quake。 And while OpenGL did great things for 3D graphics, It carried unnecessary weight to 2D Game Development. 当OpenGL在计算机3D图形方面做了很多贡献以后，它又肩负起2D开发这样一个不必要的使命。 And the developer had two options: use the unaccelerated but closer to other 2D APIs XLib or to go with the (sometimes) accelerated but unnatural OpenGL; Some of them ran to GTK and other toolkits, but most got lost on this. And then came Sam Lantinga unify our battle cries. 开发者有两个选择：第一，用未加速但是接近其他2D APIs XLib；第二，是接近加速但是违背OpenGL；他们一些人走向了GTK和其他一些开发工具，但是大部分人茫然了。后来，来了Sam Lantinga使我们重新到了一起。 Sam Lantinga had to port a Macintosh emulator to Windows and Linux...But hey, coding a graphical system for every Operating System sounds a crazy thing. Sam Lantinga 在（翻译问题had to port a Macintosh emulator to Windows and Linux...） 但是，呵，给每一个操作系统编写一个图形系统实在是一件令人疯狂的事。 And it is. He had a simple but daunting idea: write an abstraction layer, called SDL, and the rest is history : He got Doom ported to SDL is 3 days! 他有一个简单但是令人畏缩的主意：编写一个提取层，叫做SDL，接下来的事情成为了历史。 Now we can use SDL in a huge variety of platforms, ranging from mobile devices (more about this below), Video Game Consoles , and lots of mainstream and obscure operating systems. With SDL, developers could actually go through the "create window for OpenGL" novella in less than 10 lines of code.And binding for other languages spring every month or so. I bet he didn't see that coming. 现在，我们可以在多种平台上使用SDL。从移动设备、视频游戏控制器，到许多主流、非主流的操作系统。通过SDL，开发者们实际上可以用不到10行代码完成“为OpenGL创造视窗”。然后为其他语言封装？ 我打赌他没有看到这件事到来。 \*\*The Java Monster\*\* \*\*JAVA\*\*\*\*怪物\*\* The hearts of millions of programmers (those include even John Carmack) were touched with this promise: "Now we can write our own AAA game for all platforms". 成千上万的程序员的核心（他们甚至包括 John Carmack）接触这个承诺：“现在我们可以给所有的平台编写我们自己的AAA级的游戏” Unfortunately, it took a while for the idea to catch on for real. What the Java applets really were able to do was a little below that. 不幸的是，让这件事成真花了一段时间。JAVA程序并没有做到之前所承诺的那样。 But still, as Sun released their JDK for Linux, it was quickly possible to write Java applets on a Linux box and see them running on Macs and windows boxes. 但仍然，当Sun放出了Linux版本的JDk以后，它让在Linux编写Java程序再到Windows或者苹果机上运行编写的程序成为可能。 Basically , this was a time for small arcade clones and advergames. 这基本上是一个And for several startups funded for advergames, the Linux + Java applets were the killer combo. Linux+ Java的程序模式是一个杀手组合. Most of the technical staff of those came from those tech geeks who had been using Linux since college. 大部分技术人员来自到大学采用Linux的人群。 But still, the premier time for smooth Java game development was yet to come, and we will return to this later. 但是，优化Java游戏的最好时间当时还没有到来，并且我们现在将回到这之后。 \*\*Take it in your Pocket\*\* \*\*把它放到你的口袋里面\*\* If mobile is the name of the game, you're lucky. Mobile development under UNIX have been strong since the beginning , with J2ME mostly, and now, more recently, with Linux Mobile. 如果手机是游戏的代名词，那么你很幸运。在Unix下的手机开发已经比开始的时候好多了，大部分通过J2ME，现在更多的是在Linux下。 With J2ME , there are plenty of possibilities. 有了J2ME，这里有很多中可能性。 Some are more mature, like NetBeans and Sun WTK, and some brand new, like Nokia's WidSet. 一些是比较成熟的，像NetBeans 和 Sun WTK，还有一些是比较新的，像Nokia 的 WidSet。 Linux is being taken seriously by the big players, as most innovations in terms of design comes from freedom fighters, like us. Linux正在认真思考，通过那些大玩家 大多数就设计方面而言的革新是来自自由战士的，就像我们一样。The only possible downside of the approach might be the plethora of proprietary protocols mobile phones use to communicate with a computer through the data cables.唯一的坏处是过剩的连接电脑和手机的私有移动协议。 Be sure to purchase a phone that speaks "Mass Storage Device" to the computer.一定要为电脑购买“大容量存储设备”的手机。
