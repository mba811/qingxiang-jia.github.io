去年就被他感动了，上次医生说他手术很成功，可以过圣诞节，现在，愚人节都过了，我很感动，好人，还活着。去兰迪教授的网页上看了他的“day-by-day update”，摘了一些过来。

<strong>April 15, 2008: Heart Failure, Part Deux</strong>
<p>E ck. Yesterday's visit to the cardiologist showed that I'm technically back in heart failure. My &quot;ejection fraction&quot; (basically, heart output) dropped back down to 30%.</p>
<p>The good news is that only 24 hours later, the medications they put me on have put my blood pressure back in the normal range, and the diuretics have caused me to drop 4 pounds of water weight; both of which were doubtless contributors. It wasn't serious enough to land me back in the hospital, and I'm hopeful we'll have this turned around pretty quickly. The major bummer is that the blood pressure meds make me fatigued.</p>

<strong>April 12, 2008: Qualified for <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mda/docs/P990065.html">SIR-Spheres</a> at Univ. of Maryland</strong>

<p>I spent all day Thursday at the Univ. of Maryland, being seen by fantastic doctors. I am now qualified for this treatment.</p>
<p>Jai &amp; I now need to decide how much longer I need to regain my strength before we might pursue this.</p>
<p>Oh, the picture here has nothing to do with the text; I just thought it was a great photo of Chloe!</p>

<p>Robin Luo, a fellow cancer patient (see below; she's the one who got &quot;the elephant in the room&quot;) was an olympic torch carrier - how cool is that!</p>
