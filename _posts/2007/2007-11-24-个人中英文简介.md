<p>好广泛，喜欢火车、计算机及航天技术。小学开设网站——西部铁路网，成为全国办网站的年龄最小的火车迷。因此接受了宜宾电视台及日报的数次专访。初中毕业时，参加了EF英国语言夏令营，极大的开阔了眼界。高一时，对能源利用产生兴趣，设计了《镜面与绿荫－太阳能板覆盖新疆》，参加在北航举行的未来杯全国中学生创意设计比赛并获得全国二等奖。参赛期间，对航天技术产生了浓厚兴趣，以北航为自己的高考目标。以EF和未来杯的经历分别写出了数万字的游记待发表。</p>
<p>I love locomotives, computer science and space science. I wrote Westrail.net which created by the youngest locomotive fan in China . As a result I was reported by Yibin TV station and Yibin Daily. When I graduated from middle school, I join in the Language Studying Camp held by EF to go to London for one month and I learn a lot about their culture and view. Later, I was interested in energy using and I take part in the FUTURE CUP competition held in BeiHang University(a famous space science university) then I got the second prize of whole country. After that I found I start being interested in space science, and I make BeiHang University as my goal of College Entrance Examination. I have written two books about the experience of UK travel and FUTURE CUP and I want to publish them.</p>
