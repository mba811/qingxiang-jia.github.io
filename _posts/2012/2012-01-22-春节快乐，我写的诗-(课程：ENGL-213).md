Hand in Hand i Holding a walky-talky, he checks faces walking through the gate at night. Students nowadays are just so naive, looking at one of the couple, Don't understand their life and future, his forehead wrinkles. How many hands did you win today? Not much, break even. Zhou Wen-hao, go; Zhang Ting-ting, go; He Lu-xi, hold, show me your ID card? ii Bear, topless, enjoying his short duration of peace after metalworking. Just go to the bridge site, do the work so our son can use imported medicine. Too dangerous, what if I die? What will you live on? She sighs. Seeing a couple of students going by their shop, She can't help recollecting their receding happiness back to the countryside. iii Ouch!Tsunami of boiling water drowns dust on the alley. No way! I gotta catch this gold rush! Students like this couple love to buy dim sum from her stand. Noise from rubbing Mahjong across the alley comforts scalded hands. I’m not gonna give you a tiny drop! He shouts, laughing. Fine, don't buy noodles next morning! She responds, smiling. She borrowed hot water from the casino manager. iv Watermelon, non-explosive! She turns back and continues the unfinished conversation with a vegetable vendor. Three inspectors came and confiscated my spinach. Thank Jade Emperor I sold half of it ahead. Go home. Have a man to watch next time. She knows how to survive in this big city. v Old man scrutinizes the rental book inventory, As if he is counting his gray hair. He can hear the couple talking about comics. Fewer people come to his store, neighbor kids are the loyalist. He sips oolong and straightens to pull down the rolling door. Rain damps the air, muddies the alley. vi The couple merges into a boulevard, wider, brighter, cleaner; sadder, darker, bitter. They stand at the intersection. Turn left, turn right. Instead of kissing him for goodbye, she says, Tomorrow, we walk hand in hand.
